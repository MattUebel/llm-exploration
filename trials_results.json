This issue has been reported by multiple users and requires immediate attention.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the file upload section of the application.\n2. Select an unsupported file type (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`).\n3. Attempt to upload the file.\n4. Observe the application crash.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe application should display a clear error message stating that the file type is unsupported and should not crash.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe application crashes completely, requiring a restart.\n\n### Environment\n- **OS**: Windows 10, macOS 11.2\n- **Browser**: Chrome 88, Firefox 85\n- **Application Version**: 1.4.0\n\n### Possible Solution\nImplement file type validation on the client side prior to attempting the upload and enhance server-side validation to handle unsupported file types gracefully.\n\n### Additional Information\nLogs have been attached for further analysis. Addressing this issue promptly will improve user experience significantly."

This issue affects the image upload feature and causes the entire process to fail, resulting in a poor user experience.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the image upload page in the application.\n2. Select an image file larger than 2MB.\n3. Attempt to upload the image file.\n4. Observe the application crash.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe application should handle large image uploads gracefully, either by processing the upload successfully or providing a clear error message to the user.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe application crashes and does not provide any feedback to the user.\n\n### Environment\n- **Operating System**: Windows 10\n- **Browser**: Google Chrome 93\n- **Application Version**: 1.2.3\n\n### Additional Information\nLogs indicate a memory overflow error during the image processing phase. The issue does not occur with image files smaller than 2MB. Adjusting the file upload limit or optimizing the processing code may resolve this issue.\n\n### Tasks\n1. Investigate the file upload handling mechanism for memory overflow issues.\n2. Optimize the image processing code to better handle larger files.\n3. Implement proper error handling and user feedback for failed uploads.\n4. Test the fix with image files of varying sizes to ensure stability.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- The application no longer crashes when uploading images larger than 2MB.\n- Users receive a clear error message if the upload fails.\n- Successfully tested with image files ranging from small to large sizes."

Attempt to submit the form without filling out all required fields.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe user should be alerted about the missing required fields, and the form should not be submitted until all required fields are filled out.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe form is submitted even if required fields are left empty, resulting in incomplete data.\n\n### Tasks\n1. **Frontend Validation**: Implement front-end validation to check for required fields before form submission.\n2. **Backend Validation**: Ensure back-end validation is also in place to catch any instances where front-end validation might be bypassed.\n3. **User Feedback**: Display user-friendly error messages highlighting the missing required fields.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Front-end validation prevents form submission if required fields are empty.\n- Friendly error messages are displayed to the user.\n- Back-end validation ensures incomplete data is not accepted.\n\n### Additional Information\nPlease refer to the validation guidelines in the project's documentation.

This needs to be investigated and resolved to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open the application and navigate to the main dashboard.\n2. Perform a series of rapid user interactions (e.g., multiple clicks on buttons, quick form submissions).\n3. Observe the application becoming unresponsive after a short period.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe user interface should handle rapid interactions gracefully without becoming unresponsive.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe user interface hangs and does not respond to any further interactions after a series of rapid actions.\n\n### Environment\n- **Browser**: Chrome (latest version)\n- **OS**: Windows 10\n\n### Priority\nHigh\n\n### Suggested Fix\nInvestigate potential performance bottlenecks in the front-end code, such as event handling and state management issues. Review the application's usage of async operations and ensure proper resource management.\n\n### Additional Information\nLogs from the browser console and any related error messages should be attached to this issue.
